{"body":"### About Django Mango\r\nWe don't have a proper definition for the project (yet) so instead I'll to explain what its for. Last June 30 to July 1 2012 was the first ever PyCon Philippines, with only a month preparation, some things weren't smooth like the registration process, proposal submission, volunteer registration, etc. django-mango aims to solve these problems by providing a platform to manage all the moving parts in organizing a conference.\r\n\r\n### How do I contribute?\r\nWe're passionate about opensource and as such, the project shares the same. However to we need a way to organize contribution to the project so we agreed on the following guidelines:\r\n\r\n1. Fork the project at `https://github.com/pypug/django-mango`\r\n2. Commit your changes to your fork of the project and do a pull request\r\n3. Once your changes has been reviewed by the team, it'll be merged to the project\r\n\r\nWe trust everyone in the team, hence we trust their judgement against pull requests coming from contributors. At certain point in time, if the contributor earns a level of trust, we will add the user to the github organization to have a direct access on the project.\r\n\r\n**_TIP_**\r\n\r\nYour changes will have a greater success rate of being merged if your code is well documented and tested.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Jesse Panganiban (@JPanganiban)\r\n* John del Rosario (@john2x)\r\n* Marconi Moreto (@marconi)\r\n* Mark Steve Samson (@marksteve)","google":"","tagline":"More Mango, less Django!","note":"Don't delete this file!
